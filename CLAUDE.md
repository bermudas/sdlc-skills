# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A **content + distribution layer**, not an application. It ships role-based
agent personas and workflow skills, catalogs them in `skills.json`, and installs
them into any AI IDE via `bin/init.mjs` (the npx installer) or per-host native
plugin manifests. There is no build step — the installer discovers content at
runtime.

**Content lives in factories.** Each factory (`factories/<id>/`) physically owns its
`agents/` and `skills/` directories — real copies, not mirrors. The same agent
or skill id may appear in several factories with different content (intentional
divergence is normal). Top-level `agents/` and `skills/` hold only the
standalone-only "orphan" content not belonging to any factory: one agent
(`personal-assistant`) and eight skills (`deep-research`, `gathering-context`,
`verifying-outcomes`, `microsoft-365`, `obsidian-vault`, `tosca-automation`,
`vividus`, `xray-testing`). `skills.json` registers those orphan monorepo skills
plus the 28 external (`repo:`) skills fetched from upstream at install time.

Read `README.md` for the full catalog and install paths, `AGENTS.md` for the
consumer-facing summary, and `factories/SPEC.md` before touching factories.

## Commands

```bash
npm test                       # node --test (runs *.test.mjs anywhere in tree)
npm run validate               # validate:factories + validate:marketplaces — run before committing
npm run validate:factories       # bin/validate-factories.mjs — factory.json manifests
npm run validate:marketplaces  # gen-marketplaces.mjs --check — fails if generated manifests are stale
npm run gen:marketplaces       # regenerate .cursor-plugin / .codex-plugin / .github/plugin marketplaces

# Run a single test file
node --test bin/lib/item-resolver.test.mjs

# Exercise the installer against a throwaway dir
node bin/init.mjs init --factory feature-development --target claude --yes
# --bundle is a silent back-compat alias for --factory (pre-rename flag name)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs `validate-factories.mjs` and validates
every `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `factories/*/skills/*/SKILL.md` against the
agentskills.io spec via `skills-ref`.

## Architecture

**Resolution layers.** Each factory's `agents/<name>/AGENT.md` declares (in
frontmatter) the skills a role needs. `skills.json` is the registry mapping
orphan and external skill ids: monorepo entries (`monorepo: sdlc-skills`) for
the orphan skills in top-level `skills/`, and `repo: owner/repo` entries for
externals. `bin/init.mjs` resolves an agent's `skills:` list against the
registry, copies monorepo/factory skills directly, and git-clones externals into
`~/.cache/sdlc-skills/registry/` then copies (or `--symlink`s) them in.

**Standalone resolution order.** `--agents <name>` / `--skills <id>` resolve:
orphan top-level first, then alphabetical-first factory that owns the id (a
one-line notice prints when the id appears in more than one factory). Use the
qualified form `--agents <factory>/<name>` (or `--skills <factory>/<id>`) to pin
a specific factory's copy. `--factory` itself takes no such qualifier.

**Per-host install shapes.** The installer emits each host's native form:
directories for Claude/Cursor/Windsurf, flat `<name>.agent.md` for Copilot CLI
(`flattenAgentForCopilot` merges AGENT.md + SOUL.md, normalizes `model:`), and
TOML for Codex (`writeCodexAgent`). Claude Code preloads skill content from
frontmatter; for the others, `injectSkillsSection` writes a bracketed
`SKILLS-INJECTED` block into the agent file (idempotent on `--update`).

**Factories** (`factories/<id>/`) are team presets installed with `--factory`. Each
factory **physically owns** its `agents/` and `skills/` as real directories —
there is no sync and no cross-factory equality requirement. The same id may
differ across factories by design. A factory tunes the *installed copy* via two
parallel overlays: `briefings/<role>.md` (behavior → seeded into
`.agents/memory/<role>/project_briefing.md`) and `skillOverlays` in
`factory.json` (capability → rewrites the installed agent's `skills:` add/remove).
It also splices `instructions.md` into a `<!-- FACTORY:<id> -->` block in
`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` and seeds `knowledge/` reference docs. See
`factories/SPEC.md` for the full spec.

**Hooks** (`hooks/`) inject context at session/subagent start because Claude's
`@import` doesn't work in subagent files, on other IDEs, or across
`/clear`/compaction. `agent-start` injects a role's `snapshot.md` per dispatch;
`session-start` injects lean shared `.agents/*.md` docs. `hooks.json` is Claude
Code's auto-discovered config; `hooks-{codex,cursor,copilot,kiro}.json` are
templates the installer materializes per target. Big manuals are deliberately
*not* injected — agents read those on demand.

**Generated vs hand-curated manifests.** The Cursor/Codex/Copilot marketplace
manifests are generated by `gen-marketplaces.mjs` by discovering agents/skills
across top-level orphans and all factories (one entry per id, sourced from the
alphabetical-first owner) — edit the generator or sources, then
`npm run gen:marketplaces`, never the output files. An agent's `AGENT.md` or
skill's `SKILL.md` can set `discoverable: false` in its own frontmatter to be
excluded from these generated catalogs (it still installs normally).
Claude Code's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is hand-curated and left alone.

**`FACTORY.md` catalog descriptor.** Each factory ships a `FACTORY.md` with
YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `owner`, `authors` (list of
`"Name <email>"`), `sdlc_phase` (single scalar), `support_level` (`Self-Serve`
| `Best Effort Support` | `Dedicated Capacity`), `use_cases` (list), and
optional `project_deployments` (omit the key when N/A; an explicit `[]` is a
distinct "not disclosed" sentinel). `bin/validate-factories.mjs` enforces the
required fields, the `sdlc_phase`/`support_level` shape, and quoting of risky
unquoted values. See `factories/SPEC.md` for the full schema.

## What runs where: nothing ships from this repo at runtime

The agents/skills here are *installed into other projects* and run there against
the consumer's working tree and `.agents/` context. This repo only catalogs and
wires; external skills are fetched from upstream at install time (never
re-distributed). When editing an agent or skill, you're editing a template a
human will install elsewhere — not code that executes in this repo.

## Conventions

- `AGENT.md` is a role's **complete operating manual** — every standing rule
  lives there, because it is the one file every host delivers as standing
  context. `RULES.md` is only a dispatch-injection echo of it: a RULES.md whose
  header says "copied verbatim from AGENT.md" is validated line-by-line against
  AGENT.md (`bin/validate-factories.mjs`, `bin/rules-echo.test.mjs`). Skills are
  libraries the body names at the step they apply; nothing behaviour-critical
  may live only in a skill (Claude preloads `skills:`, other hosts do not).
- Agents are **self-describing**: all metadata lives in `AGENT.md` frontmatter
  (`name`, `description`, `model`, `color`, `group`, `theme`, `aliases`,
  `skills`, `skills-on-demand`, optional `mcpServers`, optional
  `context-docs`/`context-memory` — what the shared hooks inject for this
  role; feeds the installer-generated `config-defaults.sh` roster, see
  `hooks/README.md`). No separate agent
  registry. Both skill lists
  install; only `skills:` enters standing context (Claude preload, non-Claude
  injected inventory, Codex TOML). `skills-on-demand:` entries are installed
  on disk and nothing more — the agent body's prose names each one at the
  moment it applies, and the agent loads it then (Skill tool on Claude, by
  path elsewhere).
- This is **single host-native mode** — there is no dual-mode/octobots framing,
  no markers/taskbox/relay. Don't reintroduce it.
- The installer is plain ESM Node (`.mjs`), stdlib only, no dependencies. Keep it
  that way; bundled skill CLIs (e.g. `tosca_cli.py`) are the skill's own concern.
