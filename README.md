# sdlc-skills

A bundled software delivery lifecycle toolkit for Claude Code, Cursor,
Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. One repo contains:

- **Role-based agents** — BA, Tech Lead, PM, Python dev, JS dev, QA, Personal
  Assistant. Each agent ships with `AGENT.md` (frontmatter + technical
  instructions) and `SOUL.md` (personality / voice).
- **Workflow skills** — bug-fix workflow, feature planning, feature
  implementation, project seeding.
- **Generic dev skills** — code review, TDD, Playwright, git workflow.
- **Claude plugin manifest** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the
  whole repo installs via `/plugin install sdlc-skills@sdlc-skills` inside
  Claude Code.
- **Legacy npx installer** — `bin/init.mjs` so the same agents and skills
  can be dropped into `.claude/agents/` (and `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`,
  `.github/`) with a single `npx` command, no Claude plugin layer needed.

## Three ways to consume this repo

### 1. Claude Code plugin marketplace (preferred inside Claude Code)

```bash
# Add the marketplace source (once)
/plugin marketplace add arozumenko/sdlc-skills

# Install everything
/plugin install sdlc-skills@sdlc-skills

# — or install individual agents —
/plugin install sdlc-skills@ba
/plugin install sdlc-skills@tech-lead
/plugin install sdlc-skills@project-manager
/plugin install sdlc-skills@python-dev
/plugin install sdlc-skills@js-dev
/plugin install sdlc-skills@qa-engineer
/plugin install sdlc-skills@scout
/plugin install sdlc-skills@personal-assistant

# — or install individual skills —
/plugin install sdlc-skills@code-review
/plugin install sdlc-skills@bugfix-workflow
/plugin install sdlc-skills@tdd
/plugin install sdlc-skills@msgraph
# ... etc — see full list below
```

Each agent and skill is published as its own plugin entry, so you can
pick exactly what you need. The `sdlc-skills` entry installs the full
toolkit in one shot.

### 2. Direct install via npx (works for any IDE)

Copies agents and skills directly into the IDE directories of the current
project. Does not rely on Claude Code's plugin system.

```bash
# Install everything, all detected IDEs
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --all

# Install a subset of agents — every skill they declare comes along automatically
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --agents ba,tech-lead,pm
# (installs ba + tech-lead + pm agents, every monorepo skill they declare,
#  AND every external skill — tdd from mattpocock/skills, brainstorming
#  from obra/superpowers, swiftui-pro from twostraws, etc. External skills
#  are cloned once into ~/.cache/sdlc-skills/registry/ and symlinked into
#  .claude/skills/.)

# Install specific skills (overrides auto-resolve)
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --skills bugfix-workflow,code-review

# Mix and match, Claude Code only
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init \
  --agents ba,tech-lead,pm \
  --skills plan-feature,implement-feature \
  --target claude

# Update existing installs
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --all --update
```

Detected IDE directories:

| Target | Directory  | Installed path                         |
|--------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Claude Code     | `.claude/`  | `.claude/agents/<name>/`, `.claude/skills/<name>/` |
| Cursor          | `.cursor/`  | `.cursor/agents/<name>/`, `.cursor/skills/<name>/` |
| Windsurf        | `.windsurf/`| `.windsurf/agents/<name>/`, `.windsurf/skills/<name>/` |
| GitHub Copilot  | `.github/`  | `.github/agents/<name>/`, `.github/skills/<name>/` |

See `npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --help` for the full flag list.

### 3. Native plugin formats (IDE fallbacks, monorepo skills only)

In addition to the plugin marketplace and npx installer, this repo ships
native plugin manifests so IDEs with their own plugin systems can install
directly. These paths load the **monorepo skills only** — external skills
(TDD from mattpocock, Swift skills from twostraws, etc.) are not fetched
because the IDE's plugin system doesn't know about our `skills.json`
registry. Use the npx installer path above if you want the full catalog.

| IDE | File | How to install |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | Point Cursor's plugin manager at this repo |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-extension.json` + `GEMINI.md` | `gemini extensions install https://github.com/arozumenko/sdlc-skills` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI / generic | `AGENTS.md` at repo root | Copilot CLI reads `AGENTS.md` when the repo is cloned into your project |

### 4. agentskills.io / third-party consumption

Every skill under `skills/<name>/` follows the
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) spec — each has a `SKILL.md` with
`name` + `description` frontmatter at the top. Any tool that reads the spec
(Vercel's skill runtime, custom agent frameworks, other AI IDEs) can point
directly at `skills/<name>/` without going through the Claude plugin layer
or this installer.

## Using outside the Octobots supervisor

These agents and skills install cleanly into stock Claude Code (or Cursor /
Windsurf / Copilot) and are useful on their own — a BA can draft stories, a
tech-lead can review a PR, `plan-feature` and `bugfix-workflow` run
end-to-end with just `git` and `gh`. But several pieces assume the
[Octobots supervisor framework](https://github.com/arozumenko/octobots) is
running underneath them, and those assumptions will be visible if you use
the agents standalone. Read this before you install.

### Frontmatter extensions the supervisor owns

| Key | Owned by | Stock-Claude behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace: clone` | supervisor | Ignored. In Octobots, the supervisor launches `python-dev` and `js-dev` in their own git clones so branches don't collide; without it, all devs share your working tree and will step on each other. |
| `skills: [taskbox, memory, ...]` | partly supervisor | `taskbox` and `memory` are bundled *inside* the supervisor, not published here — they're no-ops on stock Claude Code, and any instruction that says "check your inbox" or "snapshot memory" will silently do nothing. |

### `@import` paths that require a seeded project

Several agents import runtime state via Claude Code's `@`-import syntax:

```markdown
@.claude/memory/<role>/snapshot.md
```

These files are written by the supervisor's `memory` skill at launch. On
stock Claude Code, the import resolves to a missing file and the agent
starts without its persistent memory. That's survivable — the agent still
works — but any phrase like "read your snapshot before acting" is a
no-op until you either (a) run the Octobots supervisor, or (b) create the
file yourself.

### Shell commands that assume the supervisor is present

Agent bodies contain commands like:

```bash
python octobots/skills/taskbox/scripts/relay.py send --from scout --to pm "…"
```

These are **hard-coded references to the supervisor's taskbox**. On stock
Claude Code they'll fail with "No such file or directory." Treat those
lines as prompts for the agent to *describe* the handoff verbally instead
— the intent (who hands work to whom, in what order) is still
communicated, even if the literal command doesn't run.

### What works unchanged on stock Claude Code

- `ba`, `tech-lead`, `project-manager`, `qa-engineer`, `scout`,
  `personal-assistant` — all run fine as subagents. They just won't send
  taskbox messages.
- Every skill under `skills/` — `plan-feature`, `bugfix-workflow`,
  `implement-feature`, `task-completion`, `code-review`, `tdd`,
  `git-workflow`, `playwright-testing`, `browser-verify`,
  `issue-tracking`, `goal-verifier`, `context-gatherer`, `deep-research`,
  `obsidian-vault`, `msgraph`. None of them depend on the supervisor.
- Developer agents work on your single working tree instead of a
  supervisor-managed clone; coordinate merges manually.

If you want the full orchestrated experience (multi-agent taskbox, per-dev
clones, supervisor TUI, persistent memory snapshots), install the
Octobots supervisor alongside these agents.

## Catalog

<!--
  This section is maintained by convention, not by a script.
  When you add an agent or skill, update the corresponding table below.
  The installer reads agents/ and skills/ at runtime, so missing a README
  entry never causes a missing install — it just hides the entry from
  human browsers of this README.
-->

### Agents (9)

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| `ba` | Business analyst — turns requirements into user stories with acceptance criteria |
| `tech-lead` | Decomposes user stories into technical tasks with dependencies |
| `project-manager` | Distributes tasks, tracks team state, escalates blockers |
| `python-dev` | Python implementation — owns its own repo clone and branch |
| `js-dev` | JavaScript / TypeScript implementation — owns its own repo clone and branch |
| `ios-dev` | iOS/Swift implementation — SwiftUI, SwiftData, Swift Testing (no simulator) |
| `qa-engineer` | Tests PRs, reports findings on the GitHub issue |
| `personal-assistant` | Conversational assistant: vault, email, calendar, daily brief |
| `scout` | Maps unfamiliar codebases — explores, documents patterns, flags risks |

### Workflow skills — SDLC-coupled (5)

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bugfix-workflow` | Structured bug investigation: reproduce → root cause → fix → regression test |
| `plan-feature` | Feature planning workflow used by BA / Tech Lead |
| `implement-feature` | Feature implementation workflow used by devs |
| `project-seeder` | Scout's project onboarding / configuration flow |
| `task-completion` | Five-step task completion protocol: verify → commit → PR → comment → notify |

### External skills (not in this repo)

Some agents declare skills that live in external repos. The installer's
registry (`skills.json` at the repo root) knows where to fetch each — when
you install an agent whose `skills:` list names an external skill, the
installer clones the source repo once into `~/.cache/sdlc-skills/registry/`
and symlinks the subdir into `.claude/skills/<name>/`. No separate step
required.

| Skill | Source | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `tdd` | [`mattpocock/skills`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) → `tdd/` | devs (`python-dev`, `js-dev`, `ios-dev`) |
| `brainstorming` | [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) → `skills/brainstorming/` | `ba` |
| `systematic-debugging` | [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) → `skills/systematic-debugging/` | devs, `qa-engineer` |
| `verification-before-completion` | [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) → `skills/verification-before-completion/` | devs, `qa-engineer` |
| `requesting-code-review` | [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) → `skills/requesting-code-review/` | devs |
| `receiving-code-review` | [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) → `skills/receiving-code-review/` | devs |
| `writing-skills` | [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) → `skills/writing-skills/` | `tech-lead` |

## Development

This repo is the single source of truth. The same files serve three
consumers (Claude Code plugin marketplace, the npx installer, agentskills.io
third-party tools) with no duplication.

When adding content:

1. **New agent** → create `agents/<name>/AGENT.md` (with YAML frontmatter:
   `name`, `description`, `model`, `color`, `skills`) and `agents/<name>/SOUL.md`.
2. **New skill** → create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with agentskills.io
   frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Put supporting files in
   `skills/<name>/references/` or `skills/<name>/scripts/`.
3. **Update the catalog tables in this README.**

No build step, no CI-generated manifests. The installer discovers content
by reading the directories at runtime — add a folder, it shows up in the
next `init` run.
