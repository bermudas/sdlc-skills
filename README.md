# sdlc-skills

A bundled software delivery lifecycle toolkit for Claude Code, Cursor,
Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. One repo contains:

- **Role-based agents** — BA, Tech Lead, PM, Python dev, JS dev, QA, Personal
  Assistant. Each agent ships with `AGENT.md` (frontmatter + technical
  instructions) and `SOUL.md` (personality / voice).
- **Workflow skills** — bug-fix workflow, feature planning, feature
  implementation, project seeding.
- **Generic dev skills** — code review, TDD, Playwright, git workflow.
- **Claude plugin manifest** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the
  whole repo installs via `/plugin install sdlc-skills@sdlc-skills` inside
  Claude Code.
- **Legacy npx installer** — `bin/init.mjs` so the same agents and skills
  can be dropped into `.claude/agents/` (and `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`,
  `.github/`) with a single `npx` command, no Claude plugin layer needed.

## Three ways to consume this repo

### 1. Claude Code plugin marketplace (preferred inside Claude Code)

```
/plugin marketplace add arozumenko/sdlc-skills
/plugin install sdlc-skills@sdlc-skills
```

Claude Code walks the plugin root, picks up everything under `agents/`,
`skills/`, `commands/`, and `mcp/`, and wires it all up automatically. One
command, whole toolkit.

### 2. Direct install via npx (works for any IDE)

Copies agents and skills directly into the IDE directories of the current
project. Does not rely on Claude Code's plugin system.

```bash
# Install everything, all detected IDEs
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --all

# Install a subset of agents
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --agents ba,tech-lead,pm

# Install specific skills
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --skills bugfix-workflow,code-review

# Mix and match, Claude Code only
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init \
  --agents ba,tech-lead,pm \
  --skills plan-feature,implement-feature \
  --target claude

# Update existing installs
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --all --update
```

Detected IDE directories:

| Target | Directory  | Installed path                         |
|--------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Claude Code     | `.claude/`  | `.claude/agents/<name>/`, `.claude/skills/<name>/` |
| Cursor          | `.cursor/`  | `.cursor/agents/<name>/`, `.cursor/skills/<name>/` |
| Windsurf        | `.windsurf/`| `.windsurf/agents/<name>/`, `.windsurf/skills/<name>/` |
| GitHub Copilot  | `.github/`  | `.github/agents/<name>/`, `.github/skills/<name>/` |

See `npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --help` for the full flag list.

### 3. agentskills.io / third-party consumption

Every skill under `skills/<name>/` follows the
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) spec — each has a `SKILL.md` with
`name` + `description` frontmatter at the top. Any tool that reads the spec
(Vercel's skill runtime, custom agent frameworks, other AI IDEs) can point
directly at `skills/<name>/` without going through the Claude plugin layer
or this installer.

## Using outside the Octobots supervisor

These agents and skills install cleanly into stock Claude Code (or Cursor /
Windsurf / Copilot) and are useful on their own — a BA can draft stories, a
tech-lead can review a PR, `plan-feature` and `bugfix-workflow` run
end-to-end with just `git` and `gh`. But several pieces assume the
[Octobots supervisor framework](https://github.com/arozumenko/octobots) is
running underneath them, and those assumptions will be visible if you use
the agents standalone. Read this before you install.

### Frontmatter extensions the supervisor owns

| Key | Owned by | Stock-Claude behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace: clone` | supervisor | Ignored. In Octobots, the supervisor launches `python-dev` and `js-dev` in their own git clones so branches don't collide; without it, all devs share your working tree and will step on each other. |
| `skills: [taskbox, memory, ...]` | partly supervisor | `taskbox` and `memory` are bundled *inside* the supervisor, not published here — they're no-ops on stock Claude Code, and any instruction that says "check your inbox" or "snapshot memory" will silently do nothing. |

### `@import` paths that require a seeded project

Several agents import runtime state via Claude Code's `@`-import syntax:

```markdown
@.octobots/memory/<role>/snapshot.md
```

These files are written by the supervisor's `memory` skill at launch. On
stock Claude Code, the import resolves to a missing file and the agent
starts without its persistent memory. That's survivable — the agent still
works — but any phrase like "read your snapshot before acting" is a
no-op until you either (a) run the Octobots supervisor, or (b) create the
file yourself.

### Shell commands that assume the supervisor is present

Agent bodies contain commands like:

```bash
python octobots/skills/taskbox/scripts/relay.py send --from scout --to pm "…"
```

These are **hard-coded references to the supervisor's taskbox**. On stock
Claude Code they'll fail with "No such file or directory." Treat those
lines as prompts for the agent to *describe* the handoff verbally instead
— the intent (who hands work to whom, in what order) is still
communicated, even if the literal command doesn't run.

### What works unchanged on stock Claude Code

- `ba`, `tech-lead`, `project-manager`, `qa-engineer`, `scout`,
  `personal-assistant` — all run fine as subagents. They just won't send
  taskbox messages.
- Every skill under `skills/` — `plan-feature`, `bugfix-workflow`,
  `implement-feature`, `task-completion`, `code-review`, `tdd`,
  `git-workflow`, `playwright-testing`, `browser-verify`,
  `issue-tracking`, `goal-verifier`, `context-gatherer`, `deep-research`,
  `obsidian-vault`, `msgraph`. None of them depend on the supervisor.
- Developer agents work on your single working tree instead of a
  supervisor-managed clone; coordinate merges manually.

If you want the full orchestrated experience (multi-agent taskbox, per-dev
clones, supervisor TUI, persistent memory snapshots), install the
Octobots supervisor alongside these agents.

## Catalog

<!--
  This section is maintained by convention, not by a script.
  When you add an agent or skill, update the corresponding table below.
  The installer reads agents/ and skills/ at runtime, so missing a README
  entry never causes a missing install — it just hides the entry from
  human browsers of this README.
-->

## Development

This repo is the single source of truth. The same files serve three
consumers (Claude Code plugin marketplace, the npx installer, agentskills.io
third-party tools) with no duplication.

When adding content:

1. **New agent** → create `agents/<name>/AGENT.md` (with YAML frontmatter:
   `name`, `description`, `model`, `color`, `skills`) and `agents/<name>/SOUL.md`.
2. **New skill** → create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with agentskills.io
   frontmatter (`name`, `description`). Put supporting files in
   `skills/<name>/references/` or `skills/<name>/scripts/`.
3. **Update the catalog tables in this README.**

No build step, no CI-generated manifests. The installer discovers content
by reading the directories at runtime — add a folder, it shows up in the
next `init` run.
