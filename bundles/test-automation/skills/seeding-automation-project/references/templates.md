## CLAUDE.md Template

Auto-loaded by Claude Code at session start. **Keep under 80 lines.** Every agent reads this on every session — be ruthlessly concise.

```markdown
# Project Name

One sentence: what it does and who it's for.

## Stack

- **Language/Runtime:** Python 3.12 / Node 20 / etc.
- **Framework:** FastAPI / Next.js / Django / etc.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite / etc.
- **Key tools:** [only what every dev touches daily]

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Install
[exact command]

# Dev server
[exact command]

# Tests
[exact command]

# Lint / type-check
[exact command]
```

## Critical Conventions

<!-- Only the rules that will cause breakage or pain if ignored -->
- [e.g. "Always run migrations before starting: `alembic upgrade head`"]
- [e.g. "Use `pnpm`, not npm — lockfile is pnpm-lock.yaml"]
- [e.g. "Feature branches only — never commit directly to main"]

## Key Paths

- Entry point: `src/main.py` / `app/page.tsx` / etc.
- Tests: `tests/` — run with `[command]`
- Config: `.env` (copy from `.env.example`)
- [Any other path every dev needs to know]

## Coding Conventions

<!-- Only include patterns actually detected in the codebase -->

- **Naming:** snake_case for files/vars, PascalCase for classes
- **Imports:** stdlib → third-party → local, absolute imports
- **Error handling:** Custom exception classes in `src/exceptions.py`
- **Code org:** Thin routes → service layer → repository → database
- **Types:** Strict mode, all public functions typed
- **Comments:** Docstrings on public APIs, no inline obvious comments

## Testing

- **Framework:** pytest / jest / vitest
- **Run:** `[exact command]`
- **Structure:** `tests/` mirrors `src/`, one test file per module
- **Fixtures:** Shared in `conftest.py` / `__tests__/setup.ts`
- **Coverage:** `[command]` (currently at X%)

## CI/CD

- **Trigger:** Push to main, PRs
- **Pipeline:** lint → type-check → test → build → deploy
- **Config:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Notes

<!-- Non-obvious things: why a dep is pinned, known tech debt, gotchas -->
- `libfoo` pinned to 2.3.1 due to breaking change in 2.4
- Database migrations must run before starting the app
- The `/legacy/` directory is deprecated but still serves traffic
```

# My Project

Brief description.

## Tech Stack
- Primary framework + version
- Database
- Key dependencies

## Build & Test
- Install: `command`
- Test: `command`
- Lint: `command`

## Conventions
- Top 3-5 conventions detected

## Environment & access

- Base URL / API base: `${BASE_URL}` (e.g. `https://staging.example.com` /
  `${API_BASE}` for the API root) — where tests point by default

### Roles & sample users

Credential matrix mapping role keys to their purpose and the env var that
holds the credential. **Never write actual secrets here** — only the env-var
name that resolves to the credential at run time.

| Role key | Purpose | Credential env var |
|----------|---------|--------------------|
| `${TEST_USER}` | Standard authenticated user — default happy-path account | `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` |
| `${TRIAL_USER}` | Trial / limited-tier account — gating & upsell paths | `TRIAL_USER_PASSWORD` |
| `${ADMIN_USER}` | Elevated / admin account — privileged flows only | `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` |
| _(add per project)_ | _(role-specific purpose)_ | _(env var, never the secret)_ |

## Project systems

_Captured during seeding-automation-project Step 0.7 from operator input (or
`Unconfirmed` when the operator didn't know yet — fill before the
first batch run)._

### Issue tracker
- **System**: <github-issues | jira | gitlab-issues | azure-boards | linear | none>
- **Project / board key**: <e.g. SCRUM, owner/repo, org/project>
- **URL**: <base URL>

### Test Management System (TMS)
- **System**: <zephyr-scale | testrail | xray | azure-test-plans | markdown | none>
- **Project key**: <SCRUM / QA-PROJECT / ...>
- **Configured in**: `.agents/test-automation.yaml` (adapter + transport + credentials)

### Task source (where work to automate comes from)
- **Intake**: <operator-drops-case-ids | tms-folder | tms-suite | jira-board-query | github-issues>
  - `operator-drops-case-ids` *(default)* — the user hands the orchestrator TMS
    case IDs / a batch to automate.
  - `tms-folder` / `tms-suite` — iterate a named TMS folder or test suite.
  - `jira-board-query` — cases linked to a board/sprint query.
  - `github-issues` — issues (label/milestone) drive the work.
- **Selector**: <the folder path / suite id / JQL / label — whatever the intake needs>

### Knowledge base
- **System**: <confluence | notion | obsidian | github-wiki | readme-only | none>
- **Space / database**: <ENG / QA-KB / ...>
- **URL**: <base URL>

### Bug filing (when the pipeline discovers a defect)

A ticket is always filed — every finding lands in a tracker so
nothing slips through. The following fields configure *where* and
whether lightweight clarifications can bundle.

- **Style**: <github-issue | story-subtask | separate-ticket>
  - `github-issue` — open an independent issue in the main issue tracker
  - `story-subtask` — create a sub-task linked to the originating
    Jira/Azure story (the one the TMS case is linked to)
  - `separate-ticket` — file in a dedicated QA/bugs tracker different
    from the main development tracker
- **Target project/board**: <leave blank to use main issue tracker;
  set when bugs go to a dedicated QA sub-project, e.g. `QA-BUGS`>
- **Bundling policy**: <strict-per-bug | bundle-per-case>
  - `strict-per-bug` *(default)* — every finding gets its own ticket.
  - `bundle-per-case` — lightweight clarifications / questions about
    the same TMS case may be consolidated into one umbrella ticket
    (new findings added as comments on the existing per-case ticket).
    Real defects (reproducible bugs, blockers) still get their own
    tickets regardless — bundling only applies to the clarification-
    weight tier. The bundling decision is the filing agent's — they
    classify each finding at filing time.
- **Link originating case**: <yes | no> — should the ticket reference
  the TMS case ID that surfaced it?

### Test case storage
- **Source of truth**: <tms | markdown | both-synced | none>
  - `tms` — cases live in the TMS only
  - `markdown` — cases live as files under `tasks/<suite>/`
  - `both-synced` — TMS is authoritative; markdown mirrors for
    git-tracking / offline access
- **Markdown location**: `tasks/` (or project-specific path)

### Status reporting

_Which outward-facing writes the pipeline performs at task completion. The
implementer / orchestrator read this before posting; if a write is `no`, they
skip it silently — it's not part of this project's way of work._

- **TMS execution back-write**: <yes | no> — push pass/fail/blocked back to the
  TMS execution record after a run. Implies a real `tms.adapter` (not
  `markdown` / `none`); `no` for projects that don't track executions in a TMS.
- **Comment PR link on the originating story/issue**: <yes | no> — post the
  automation PR link as a comment on the linked story. `no` where bots commenting
  on stories is unwanted.
- **File tickets for defects**: governed by **§ Bug filing** above (`none` there
  = don't file).
- **Gating**: result back-write runs only in CI / under an opt-in flag, never on
  a local dev run (see the `test-automation-implementation` skill, references/reporters.md).

### Automation PR policy

_Where automation PRs target, and who merges them. Read by the
orchestrator (merge gate) and the implementer (branch base)._

- **Base branch for automation PRs**: <main | master | develop |
  feature/<name> | ASK>
  - The branch automation feature branches are cut FROM and
    target PR AGAINST. Defaults to the project's
    `default-branch` from the frontmatter above unless the team
    uses a dedicated line for test-automation work (common in
    pilot / testing mode — e.g. `feature/test-automation-pilot`).
- **Merge policy**: <auto-merge | human-approved | manual>
  - `auto-merge` *(default)* — the orchestrator (test-automation-lead)
    merges once review + CI pass. Closes the loop autonomously; best
    for mature pipelines.
  - `human-approved` — the orchestrator **waits for an explicit human
    approval signal** on the PR (e.g. the `human-approved` label, or a
    reviewer from a designated human set) before merging. It still
    owns the merge — it just doesn't fire on review-bot approval alone.
  - `manual` — the orchestrator never merges. Summarizes the green PR
    and hands back to the operator. Right when the project is in
    early pilot mode, or base branch is a protected release line.
- **Squash / rebase / merge commit**: <squash | rebase | merge>
  — optional; defaults to `squash`. Override when the project's
  branch-protection rules require a different strategy.
- **Landing granularity**: <per-batch | campaign-end>
  - `per-batch` *(default)* — each batch lands to base as soon as its gate is
    green, so value arrives early, base drift stays small, and a red gate
    blocks only its own batch. The next batch then cuts its trunk from an
    updated base.
  - `campaign-end` — gated batch branches accumulate and land together in one
    PR. Right when base is a protected release line or PR ceremony is
    expensive; the cost is that nothing ships until the campaign finishes and
    base drifts underneath the whole run.
  - Either way the gate is per batch — nothing reaches base ungated, and a
    campaign runs one final check of everything it delivered (see
    `test-automation-workflow` campaign-planning.md).

### Reporting policy

_Where the batch report goes at close. Read by the orchestrator's close
step. The report itself is ALWAYS assembled by script
(`work-scope.mjs close` renders `.agents/automation/<slug>/batch-report.md`
+ `.html` where the tokenomics scope contract is active) — this policy only
decides whether and where a copy is DELIVERED._

- **Publish batch report to**: <none | tracker-item | pr-comment | ASK>
  - `none` *(default when absent — and the close flags the gap)* — the
    report stays in the repo as files; nothing is posted anywhere.
  - `tracker-item` — a dispatched cheap-tier publisher posts the report
    (or its summary + link) as a comment on the batch's tracker item —
    name the tracker and item convention here (e.g. "the GitHub issue the
    batch was planned on", a Jira epic key pattern).
  - `pr-comment` — posted on the batch's landing PR.
- **Format**: <full-body | summary-with-link> — optional; defaults to
  `summary-with-link` (totals + delivered list + drift flags, linking the
  in-repo file) so tracker items stay readable.

_Free-form way-of-work context that doesn't fit a structured field above —
exceptions, timing constraints, who to loop in, tribal knowledge. Carried
verbatim from the operator's onboarding prompt; `none` if they left it blank._

- <verbatim operator notes, or `none`>
```

## .agents/workflow.md Template

Generated by Step 0.5 (PR sampling). Describes **how the team
actually works** — roles, review cadence, branch/commit conventions,
how tests ship relative to code — all derived from classifying +
sampling representative PRs, not inferred from static repo content.

If the repo has no merged PRs yet, write the "No PR history" stub at
the bottom instead of the full structure.

```markdown
# How This Team Works

_Derived from PR sampling on {YYYY-MM-DD}. Refresh when the team's
patterns shift (new leads, process changes, framework overhaul)._

## Git host

- **Host**: GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / Azure DevOps / Gitea / other
- **Remote URL pattern**: {e.g. `git@github.com:acme/repo.git`}
- **CLI of choice**: `gh` / `glab` / `bb` / `az repos` / `tea` / curl
- **Unit of change**: Pull Request (GitHub / Bitbucket / Gitea) /
  Merge Request (GitLab) / Pull Request in the Azure sense
- **Any host-specific conventions**: required approvers count,
  merge-queue integration, automerge labels, draft-PR workflow,
  squash-vs-rebase policy — whatever you observed

Downstream agents: use the CLI named above when opening PRs/MRs,
commenting, checking review status, etc. Do NOT assume `gh` —
always read this section first.

## PRs sampled

- Framework / infrastructure: #<n>, #<n>, #<n>
- Test implementation:        #<n>, #<n>, #<n>
- Bugfix + regression:         #<n>, #<n>
- Feature + tests:             #<n>, #<n>, #<n>
- Total merged PRs scanned: <N> (ignored <M> bot / docs / format-only)

## Team & roles

- **Who authors feature tests**: <roles / specific people, derived from
  author patterns on feature-PRs>
- **Who authors regression tests**: <same for bugfix-PRs>
- **Who owns framework / infra changes**: <same for infra PRs>
- **Review / approval gates**: <N reviewers required / specific approvers
  required for specific directories>

## Review gates

- Typical reviewer count: <N>
- Consistently-flagged review comments (from reading comment threads):
  - <pattern 1 — e.g. "no hardcoded selectors, use data-testid">
  - <pattern 2 — e.g. "page objects can't do assertions">
- Code-owner files / directories (from CODEOWNERS if present): <list>

## Branching & commits

- Branch naming: <e.g. `automation/<ticket>-<slug>`,
  `fix/<ticket>-<slug>`, feature branches via `feature/<name>`>
- Commit message style: <Conventional Commits? Plain? Ticket-prefixed?>
  - Example: <actual example from a recent PR>
- Ticket linking: <"Closes #NN" / "Fixes ABC-123" / inline body>

## Test delivery pattern

- Do tests ship **with** the feature PR or **separately** afterward?
  <evidence — cite specific PRs>
- Do bugfixes always include a regression test? <yes / sometimes / rarely>
- Typical test-PR size: <N files / N lines / one test case>

## CI gates

- Required checks that must pass: <list from CI config + observed in PRs>
- Required labels to merge: <if any>
- Auto-merge behavior: <if configured>

## Patterns observed in practice

- <How new page objects are added — evidence from a specific PR>
- <How new fixtures are added — evidence from a specific PR>
- <Any codified "don't do this" patterns from review comments>

## Evolution signals

_Framework / infrastructure change pace, from infra-PR cadence._

- Infra PRs per month (approximate): <N>
- Typical author of infra changes: <role / person>
- Last major framework change: PR #<n> — <one-sentence description>

## Unconfirmed

- <Anything PR sampling couldn't determine — flag for manual fill-in>
```

### No-PR-history stub

For a brand-new project with no merged PRs yet, write this minimal
version:

```markdown
# How This Team Works

_This project has no merged PR history yet, so scout couldn't sample
representative work. Re-run the scout survey once the first ~10 PRs
have landed — patterns only become visible at that point._

## Unconfirmed (everything — populate after first merges)

- Roles — who authors feature tests vs regression vs infra work
- Review cadence — reviewer counts, comment patterns
- Branch & commit conventions
- Test-delivery pattern — tests bundled with features or separate?
- CI gates
```

## .agents/testing.md Template

Read by the lead and engineer before they touch tests.
**Treat the sections below as themes, not required fields** — except
§ Execution provider, § Coverage idiom, § Knowledge routing, and
§ Base URL mapping, which the batch pipeline requires. Scout fills
what the repo actually evidences; unknown or absent topics are flagged
under § Unconfirmed so agents know to ask the orchestrator
(test-automation-lead) before improvising. Stay short — link to deeper
docs rather than restating them.

```markdown
# Testing

> Scout-generated. Update when the framework, run commands, or
> conventions change. Agents read this before adding tests.

## Framework
- **Name + version:** e.g. Playwright 1.47 / Cypress 13 / pytest 8 +
  playwright-python 0.4 / WDIO 8 / JUnit 5 + Playwright-Java / NUnit 4
- **Test type:** ui | api | mobile | perf | mixed — free text (on a
  mixed repo, note which directories are which)
- **Why this stack** (only if non-obvious from the repo)

## Framework skill
- **Skill:** <the installed skill carrying this framework's patterns and
  design rules — `playwright-best-practices` for Playwright, `vividus`,
  `tosca-automation`, a catalogue or project-local skill for Selenium,
  qavajs or anything else — or `none`>. The engineer opens it before
  building; its design rules win over the generic ones in the agent body.

## Execution provider
- **Provider:** <manual-qa | self> — `manual-qa` when manual-qa personas
  are in the host agent roster **and** `.agents/manual-qa/` exists;
  `self` otherwise. Routes batch triage (verified / needs-execution /
  combined); under `manual-qa` the pipeline never self-executes a case —
  a missing run makes the unit `needs-execution`.

## Coverage idiom
- **Idiom:** <framework-native carrier — e.g. Playwright →
  `test.step()` per case step + header comment; pytest → docstring +
  markers; JUnit/REST-assured → `@DisplayName` + `@Tag`; k6 → `group()`>
- The baseline comment grammar (`TC-<id> coverage:` / `TC-<id>
  excluded:`) is always present regardless of idiom — it is what the
  gate greps. Grammar + exclusion vocabulary:
  `<skills root>/test-automation-workflow/references/coverage-contract.md`.

## Knowledge routing
| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Hot handles, waits, quirks (high churn) | `.agents/automation/surface/<feature>.md` — TA working cache |
| Durable, verified, cross-role system facts | `.agents/knowledge/` via the knowledge-curation skill (admission tests apply) |
| Process / personal lessons | `.agents/memory/<role>/` via the memory skill |
| manual-qa's `.agents/manual-qa/**` | READ-ONLY warm start — before writing an app fact to the surface cache, check their knowledge/; if present, reference it, never copy |

## Base URL mapping
- Authored cases template `{{base_url}}` (manual-qa convention). This
  project resolves it from `${<VAR_NAME>}` — record the actual var
  (matches `.agents/profile.md` § Environment & access) so generated
  code and test-runner dispatches point at the same target.

## Merge gate
- **N:** <consecutive green runs the gate requires before a unit merges;
  default 3 when absent — raise for suites with parallel-interaction
  flakes, never below 2>

## Case ownership
- **Owner:** <manual-qa | automation> — `manual-qa` (or absent → read-only
  for TA) when manual-qa is installed or cases come from a TMS;
  `automation` when the automating team also authors the markdown cases
  in this repo. Even then, what a case asserts changes only through a
  filed clarification.

## Run commands
- **Single test, local:** exact command (include env wrappers and
  reporter flags if the project uses them — e.g.
  `npx cross-env TEST_ENV_NAME=SIT1 LOCAL_RUN=true npx playwright test path/to/spec --grep TC-001 --reporter=list`)
- **Whole suite, local:** exact command
- **CI variant — what the pipeline actually runs:** exact command,
  verbatim. Tests the implementer writes must be runnable with this command.
- **Differences to flag** (retry count, env, …) — anything that changes
  test behavior between local and CI.
  <!-- UI suites only — also flag headless vs headed, viewport; omit for API / perf / mobile projects -->

## Structure
- **Tests live in:** `tests/` / `e2e/` / `cypress/e2e/` /
  `src/test/java/` / …
- **Folder roles** (one line each — omit folders that don't exist; don't
  invent):
  - `<dir>/specs/` or `<dir>/` — test files; grouped by feature, not by
    ticket ID
  - `<dir>/pages/` — Page Object classes (if used)
  - `<dir>/steps/` — extracted `test.step` helpers (if extracted; some
    teams keep `test.step()` inline in spec files instead — record which)
  - `<dir>/fixtures/` — framework fixtures (Playwright / pytest /
    JUnit-extensions)
  - `<dir>/helpers/` — utility functions, **grouped by topic** (one file
    per topic, e.g. `helpers/auth.ts`, `helpers/api/orders.ts`).
    Suite-local helpers stay in the spec file
  - `<dir>/data/` — test data (JSON / CSV / SQL fixtures)

## Test data strategy
- **Where data lives** (path)
- **Generation pattern:** reuse-existing / generate-per-test /
  generate-shared-with-cleanup / mixed — and **how to tell which
  applies for a new test**
- **Cleanup ownership:** afterEach / afterAll / external script / none
- **Stable records tests may assert on read-only:** <record id → why it
  is stable>; the environment tests run against and the credential env
  keys (or a pointer to `.agents/profile.md` § Environment & access)
- **Anything project-specific** (tenant scoping, env-keyed subfolders
  like `data/sit1/`, factories vs JSON, …)

## Hooks, fixtures, and run-mode policy
- **Auth fast-path for exploration** — how an agent gets an authenticated
  browser WITHOUT manual login: storage-state file path + the command that
  refreshes it, or the login helper/fixture to run. Builders use this to
  fast-reach areas under test; scout captures it once for everyone.
- **Auto-applied hooks** the framework wires in (authed session,
  base URL, browser context …) — name + where they live
  <!-- UI suites only — browser-context/viewport/headless framing; omit for API / perf / mobile projects -->
- **Project-wide teardown / reset** — name + trigger
- **Serial vs parallel rule:** when does the project enforce serial
  mode (`test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` or equivalent)?
  Data dependency is the usual reason — document the rule explicitly so
  the implementer applies it correctly when a case's test data is
  shared.

## Locator strategy
<!-- UI suites only — omit for API / perf / mobile projects -->
- **Ladder** (preferred order):
  `getByRole` with accessible name → `getByTestId` / `data-testid` →
  `getByLabel` / `getByPlaceholder` → `getByText` →
  CSS / XPath as last resort (with a comment explaining why)
- **Stop+flag rule:** if a target element has no test ID **and** roles
  / labels are insufficient (multi-match accessible name, no a11y
  affordance), the implementer pauses and surfaces the gap to the
  orchestrator (test-automation-lead) rather than falling back to
  brittle CSS chains.
- **Edge cases & project exceptions** — record any selectors where the
  default ladder doesn't fit (e.g. a component library that wraps role
  internally; legacy widgets with no accessibility tree)
- **Existing testid convention** — pattern + example
  (e.g. `data-testid="<feature>-<element>"`)

## Reporters & evidence
- **Local artifacts:** where the framework writes them
  (`playwright-report/`, `test-results/screenshots/`, …)
- **CI artifacts:** what the pipeline uploads (HTML report, JSON,
  videos)
- **Step logger / reporter:** Allure / `test.step` / custom — name and
  how to extend, so the implementer integrates rather than introducing a
  new one

## CI integration
- **Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/<name>.yml` (or GitLab CI /
  Azure Pipelines equivalent)
- **Trigger:** on push / PR / both
- **Timeout & retry policy:** [X min; project-default retry count]
- **Coverage threshold:** [X% or N/A]

## Merge gate
- **Gate N**: <number> — consecutive deterministic green runs the
  orchestrator requires at the batch hardening gate before merge.
  Default: 3.
- **Reviewer live re-run**: <off | on> — `off` *(default)*: the reviewer
  slot reviews statically (the hardening gate is the only independent
  execution). `on`: the reviewer also executes the spec once — belt-and-
  braces for teams that want a second runtime environment before the gate.

## Batch pipeline
- **Batch size M**: <number> — default cases per batch; `1` degenerates to
  the per-case flow. Default: 5. Raise toward 8–12 once the pipeline is
  trusted: intake, the gate (N runs regardless of size), and the mirror
  sweep are ~fixed per batch, so per-case overhead falls as M grows.
- **Clustering** — the throughput lever, since units run one at a time and
  the number of UNITS is the wall clock. A cluster is one build unit over
  ≤5 same-surface flow variants; note here any surface where clustering is
  known to work well or badly. (There is no concurrency knob: a batch never
  runs two writers against the one working tree.)
- **Run artifacts**: `.agents/automation/<slug>/` — the case snapshots the
  lead writes at intake (`cases/<ID>.md`) and the run's report
  (`report.json` + `report.md`). Fixed convention; created on demand. There
  is no progress board: the run reports once at close, and an interrupted
  one is rebuilt from git + the run journal.
- **Mid-batch tracker writes**: <batched | per-dispatch> — `batched`
  *(default)*: tracker/TMS are written at intake and the close sweep only.
  `per-dispatch`: also mirror each slot transition (for teams whose
  stakeholders watch the tracker live). **`per-dispatch` forces the
  sequential-dispatch path** — a workflow run has no mid-run writer, so on
  Claude Code this trades the accelerant for tracker liveness; the lead
  writes between dispatches.
- **Campaign mode**: for backlogs ≳ 2×M, compose waves + a foundation pass
  + clusters of similar cases per the `test-automation-workflow` skill's
  `campaign-planning.md` (plan proposed by a dispatched planner; foundation
  mini-gate = its smoke spec × Gate N green before base merge).

## TMS case-gate
- **Excluded author statuses**: <list — e.g. Out of Scope, Untested,
  Draft> — cases whose TMS author-status is listed here are skipped at
  batch intake. Probe the status field directly (JQL-style queries on TMS
  custom fields are unreliable across adapters). Empty = fetch all.

## Conventions to follow when adding tests
> Bullets — short, observed-from-repo. Aspirational rules go in the
> framework guide; this section captures what the project actually does.
- One `describe` per feature file; tests grouped by feature
- Steps inline OR extracted to `<dir>/steps/` — pick whichever the
  project uses
- Helpers grouped by topic; suite-local helpers stay in the spec file
- Env values via the project's existing loader; **grep for an existing
  key before adding a new one** (no duplicate config)
- Data-dependent tests run in serial mode
- Helpers are trusted: when a test fails and the helper has worked
  elsewhere, suspect the test first

## Known issues
- [Flaky areas, slow suites, environments with known incompatibilities,
  any framework-version pitfalls]

## Unconfirmed
- [Scout's flagged gaps — the engineer asks the orchestrator / user
  before improvising on these]

## `.agents/memory/<role-id>/project_briefing.md` Template

Per-role briefing, seeded by scout as a `type: project` curated entry
conforming to the `memory` skill spec. Scout also appends one line to
`.agents/memory/<role-id>/MEMORY.md` pointing at `project_briefing.md`
(see "Index line" below).

"My Role Focus" is not a template placeholder — scout writes it based on
actual understanding of what this role does on this specific project.

```markdown
---
name: Project briefing
description: Scout-seeded project overview — stack, stage, key paths, and this role's focus
type: project
---

## Project Knowledge

- **Project:** [name — one sentence description]
- **Stack:** [engine / framework / primary language and version]
- **Stage:** [pre-init / alpha / active development / maintenance]
- **Key paths:** [entry point], [test dir], [config file]
- **Issue tracker:** [URL] — [N] open issues, Phase [N] due [date if known]
- **Design docs:** [location — GDD, spec, architecture doc, etc.]

## My Role Focus

[One paragraph specific to this role on this project. What does this role actually
do here? Examples:

- python-dev repurposed as Godot dev:
  "Write GDScript for game systems — state machines, combat, inventory. No Python.
   Engine binary at bin/Godot.app. GDD in gdd/ defines all systems."

- js-dev repurposed as Level Designer:
  "Design TileMap scenes and biome layouts in Godot scenes. No JS/TS.
   Level assets in assets/levels/. See gdd/world-design.md for biome specs."

- test-automation-engineer on a GUT project:
  "Tests use GUT framework (Godot addon, not installed yet — see issue #42).
   Run from Godot editor or CLI. Phase 1 DoD checklist is in .agents/testing.md."

- project-manager on any project:
  "Coordinate Phase 1 work: [N] issues, deadline [date]. Unblock: [first issue]."
]

## Known gotchas

[Things that would bite this role specifically — pinned versions, flaky
tests, files they must not touch, conventions that are non-obvious.]
```

### Index line

Add this single line to `.agents/memory/<role-id>/MEMORY.md` (creating the
file if it doesn't exist):

```markdown
# Memory index — [role-id]

- [Project briefing](project_briefing.md) — Scout-seeded project overview
```

The agent adds further curated entries (user preferences, feedback,
references, etc.) below during work sessions — same index, same spec.
