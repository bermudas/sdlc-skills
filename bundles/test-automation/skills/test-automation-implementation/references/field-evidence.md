# Field evidence & worked examples

The measured incidents and worked examples behind the norms in `SKILL.md`.
The rules there are binding on their own; read this when you want the
reasoning, or when you're tempted to treat one as negotiable.

## Waiting on long runs (Phase 4)

**Why "never end a turn waiting" is absolute.** Measured in a controlled
probe (2026-08-10): a dispatched slot that ends its turn mid-job is forced
to report **28ms later**, and *both* the documented `run_in_background`
completion notification and the Monitor tool lose that race. What actually
happens is that your slot goes silent holding an unfinished branch; and
inside a batch, the workflow is blocked on your return, so one idled run
stalls the whole campaign behind it, with a `pending` journal entry and no
error anywhere to explain it.

**Why busy-polling is forbidden.** You pay a full resident context on every
turn: measured at 132k context, a poll costs ~$0.048, and one gate agent's
27 `kill -0` checks burned $1.29 — a third of its total cost — before being
cut off with no verdict. The same wait as two `sleep 300` calls: $0.10.

**The canonical failure.** Measured on the lazy-modal foundation build
(2026-07-30): the engineer backgrounded the full suite, wrote *"I'll
wait for this full-suite run to complete"*, and stopped. Twelve minutes
later its output file was still empty, the conductor was still waiting, and
it took a human noticing plus a rescue dispatch to finish a branch that was
nearly done. The rescue agent's own note is the rule: *"run synchronously
in the foreground — this is exactly the step the prior session backgrounded
and abandoned."*

## Context economy

**Turn economics.** Field measurement: workers averaged ~30 turns at ~1
tool call per turn before the batching rule; 15 batched turns carry what
~40 single-call turns did.

**The wholesale-clean incident (2026-08-03).** One
`git stash --include-untracked` before a `git checkout` swept six freshly
written memory entries and three receipts; every later agent ran without
them. Role memory is committed by exact path by default (a project may gitignore
it as its own choice), but anything not yet committed is exposed — anything
plain-untracked (a surface-cache note just written, a spec mid-edit)
vanishes with no diff and no error.

**Why self-check greps scope to the code root.** An unscoped
locator-policy grep matched dozens of documentation strings in memory
prose — run mechanical diff scans against the project's code root
(e.g. `git diff … -- automation/`), never the whole tree.

## Reverse-masking — worked examples (Hard Rule 2)

The case text is a *hypothesis*; the live product is ground truth.
Weakening an assertion *toward* stale case text is masking too:

| Case text says | Live product does | Wrong — reverse-masking | Right — live-contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tap target ≥44px (WCAG AAA) | Tap target = 40px (per current design spec) | `expect(box.height).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(44)` — fails on a non-defect | `expect(box.height).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(40)` + file CLARIFICATION on case-text drift |
| "Save button visible on form" | Save button correctly removed in v2 redesign | `expect(saveBtn).toBeVisible()` — fails on intentional change | `expect(saveBtn).toHaveCount(0)` + CLARIFICATION |
| Field labelled "Customer" | Field labelled "Constituent" (legacy term, behaviour identical) | Assert "Customer" — fails on cosmetic | Assert "Constituent" + CLARIFICATION |
| Step "click confirm dialog" | No confirm dialog (removed in flow simplification) | `expect(dialog).toBeVisible()` — fails on improved UX | Assert the live flow + CLARIFICATION; divergence noted beside the coverage line |

Why this matters empirically: a stale-hypothesis assertion will
pass-by-luck on the next product change that happens to land on the
asserted value, then fail unpredictably when the product moves again. The
live-contract assertion is durable.

## Read-only-by-default — why (Hard Rule 10)

Seed/cleanup is the largest flake source in any non-trivial suite — state
leaks across tests, fixtures interact with parallel runners, cleanup race
conditions. Eliminating the mutation eliminates the entire flake class.

The rule sequence: Rule 7 (reuse before create) tells you to find an
existing helper; Rule 10 tells you to find existing **data**. Both are the
same instinct — prefer what's already proven stable over freshly-built
state.

## Scaffold minimal — why (Hard Rule 12)

An unsolicited side-effect — the `jira-reporter`-firing-on-every-local-
`npx playwright test` class, making per-test network calls that fail and
spam offline — breaks local dev and erodes trust. The user asked for
tests, not for their machine to phone a TMS on every run.

## Memory commit safety — the numbers (Hard Rule 11)

cov60: 26 of 32 merge conflicts were memory add/add collisions from
parallel branches; serializing the pipeline retired that cause. That is
why commit-in-place is safe *only* under a pipeline dispatch that grants
exclusive tree ownership — and why the parallel-context default is the
memory skill's base-branch caution.
