// Canonical batch workflow for the test-automation pipeline.
// Claude Code only — invoked by the orchestrator via
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: '<installed skill>/scripts/workflows/batch-build.workflow.mjs',
//              args: { slug, base, cases: [{id, title?}, …], clusters?, … } })
//
// ONE workflow, ONE report. TA v2 is a COMPILER from test cases to test code:
// input is ready-made cases (TMS snapshots or in-repo TC files) plus execution
// evidence when it exists; output is merged automated tests, the surface cache,
// and one report the lead acts on — land what is `delivered`, classify what is
// red, replan the rest. There is no intermediate spec artifact: the CASE (which
// TA never edits) and the CODE are the two sources of truth, joined by the
// coverage contract (a machine-findable comment block per case, checked
// mechanically by the gate and semantically by the reviewer).
//
//   triage       → one cheap dispatch reads the seeded execution-provider
//                  policy and routes every unit: manual-qa-verified |
//                  needs-execution | combined
//   for each unit, IN ORDER, on the batch trunk:
//     execute    → (needs-execution only) manual-qa's test-runner per case;
//                  FAIL files a defect and stops the case, BLOCKED stops it
//     build      → one engineer dispatch derives the spec from the case and
//                  implements it on a unit branch cut FROM the trunk
//     review     → static, engineer-typed with the reviewer contract loaded
//     fix        → rounds until APPROVED (see loopVerdict)
//     merge      → the unit branch into the trunk, then the tree RETURNS to it
//   gate         → the batch's specs together, N consecutive green + affected
//                  specs + the mechanical coverage check
//   report       → one writer, at close
//
// EXECUTION-PROVIDER POLICY (.agents/testing.md § Execution provider, seeded by
// scout): `manual-qa` when that factory co-installs, `self` otherwise. Under
// `self` every unit routes `combined` and the ritual "execute the full case
// before automating" is DEAD — the first green run of the automated test
// against the real system IS the case's first execution; a live browser is an
// investigation tool, not a stage. Under `manual-qa` the pipeline NEVER
// executes a case itself: evidence exists → build from it; evidence missing →
// dispatch their test-runner per case; test-runner unavailable → the case is
// honestly `needs-execution` and the report says to run the manual-qa suite.
//
// ONE TREE, ONE MASTER — the invariant everything else rests on. There is no
// concurrency here at all, and that is the design, not a limitation:
//
//   Always return the tree to a known state, and always branch from it.
//
// A single working tree has ONE state at a time, but concurrent slots need
// DIFFERENT states — one wants base, a reviewer wants the branch it is
// judging, an implementer wants its own. No rule can reconcile that; only
// ordering can. An earlier revision ran slots in parallel and paid for it in
// the field: eight `local changes would be overwritten by checkout` aborts,
// merge conflicts concentrated in shared page objects, 90 conflict hits and
// three git-surgery rescues in one session. Units merge as they finish, so
// integration is continuous and conflicts surface small, early, and while
// their author is still live.
//
// THROUGHPUT COMES FROM CLUSTERING, NOT CONCURRENCY. Units are the wall clock,
// so a cluster of 5 is one unit rather than five.
//
// WHY NO BOARD. Earlier revisions kept a `.agents/automation-board/` state
// machine — 15 statuses, legal transitions, a serialized clerk applying every
// flip. It existed to record PROGRESS, and progress only needs recording if
// something reads it mid-run. Nothing does: the runtime already persists every
// agent's full return to the run's `journal.jsonl` as it completes, and
// `resumeFromRunId` replays completed calls from cache. The board was a second,
// hand-maintained copy of that — and it drifted: 4 of 12 merged cases in one
// campaign ended mis-stated, one sitting at `analysis` despite a merge commit.
// What survives an interruption now: the journal (every return), git (branches,
// PRs, the surface cache), and the report once it lands. Recovery turns the
// first two into the third by hand — playbook § Interruption and resumption.
//
// OUTCOMES, NOT STATUSES. A case ends somewhere; it does not travel through a
// state machine. The vocabulary is closed: `delivered | defect-found | blocked
// | un-automatable | needs-execution | infra-stalled | not-started` — plus two
// bookkeeping values: the in-flight markers (`built`, `reviewed`) that never
// survive a completed run, and `merged-ungated` for the one state the closed
// set cannot say honestly (merged on the trunk, gate never produced a verdict —
// labelling those `blocked` once made a dead run's summary a false negative:
// "blocked: 14" while 13 of the 14 were already merged). `findings` —
// orthogonal — say what turned up on the way: a case can be `delivered` AND
// have filed two defects and raised a question.
//
// UNITS & CLUSTERS: work flows in units of 1..k cases. A cluster (args.clusters,
// declared by the plan per campaign-planning.md) is a pack of genuinely similar
// same-surface cases built by ONE engineer on ONE branch — a parameterized spec
// (one row per case) only where the cases are true variants of one flow, the
// engineer's judgment from the case files. Unlisted cases run as solo units.
// With builds sequenced, UNITS are the wall clock, so clustering is the main
// throughput lever a batch has.
//
// PROMPT DETERMINISM IS THE RESUME CONTRACT (field lesson, 2026-07-24 — it cost
// one campaign ~2x). `resumeFromRunId` caches every agent() call keyed on the
// EXACT (prompt, opts) pair, so any value interpolated into a prompt that
// depends on RUN TIMING rather than on the args breaks the cache on every
// resume and the agent re-runs live. An earlier revision handed out browser
// lanes from a counting semaphore (completion order): measured, 35 of 53
// analysed cases were re-run from scratch. Serialising removed that whole
// class: every unit branches from the TRUNK, whose name comes from args, so no
// prompt depends on who finished first. When editing: interpolate args and
// worker RESULTS, never anything derived from completion order.

// Field lesson, 2026-07-30 (lazy-modal foundation): an implementer backgrounded

// raised anywhere, and finishing a nearly-done branch took a human noticing and
// dispatching a rescue. There is no timer, and no operator watches an
// individual slot — an agent that idles is an agent that died quietly.
//
// This goes to EVERY worker, not just implementers: the gate is the most
// exposed slot of all, because running the suite N consecutive times is its
// whole contract.
//
// Measured 2026-08-10, controlled probe, two arms: a schema-bound workflow
// subagent that ends its turn while a job runs is forced to report in 28ms —
// the documented run_in_background "you will be re-invoked when it exits" path

// probe a BLOCKING foreground `sleep` worked perfectly (3 x 45s, no
// enforcement), which is why the rule below names sleep as the way to wait:
// waiting is legal, idling is fatal, and nothing previously said so.
//
// The other half is arithmetic. A foreground call is capped at 600s (default
// 120s if `timeout` is not passed), while N=3 over a real UI batch is 12-19
// minutes — so "let the call block" ALONE is unsatisfiable, and every gate that
// tried it was killed, auto-backgrounded, and then trapped. And you pay per
// TURN, not per minute: at 132k resident context a poll costs ~$0.048, so
// wave-01's 27 `kill -0` polls burned $1.29 (32% of that agent) and it still
// failed. One `sleep 300` costs the same as one 2-second check.

A modified symbol in a base class or fixture that everything reaches makes the big set REAL — report its size and estimated runtime in notes and let the lead decide run-vs-sample rather than silently burning the hour. A red here is a REGRESSION and belongs in failures[] like any other, flagged in notes as pre-existing-code rather than new-code. ` +

    `When you are done, LEAVE THE TREE ON ${gateBranch} — \`git checkout ${gateBranch}\` after the script's detached run — because the next step assumes it is there. ` +
    'On red: read the runner\'s STRUCTURED report (JSON/HTML) for per-spec verdicts rather than log-diving, and return one failures[] entry per failing spec with its failure signature and, where the spec names them, the case ids it covers. ' +
    'One distinction you MUST make, because only you see the runner output: a spec that FAILED (an assertion, a timeout, an error inside the test) versus a spec that never ran (module not found, worker crash, 0ms duration, collection error). The second is an infrastructure fact — a file missing from the merge, a dependency not installed — and reporting it as a red case sends the lead hunting a bug that does not exist. Put such failures in `failures` with the signature verbatim AND say in notes that the spec did not execute. ' +
    // The enum distinction only pays off if the gate knows which one it is.
    `IF YOU ARE CUT OFF before the ${GATE_N} runs finish — you are told to report while a run is still going — use verdict 'incomplete', NOT 'not-run'. They mean different things: 'not-run' is "nothing was attempted", 'incomplete' is "I was mid-flight". With 'incomplete' set runs to the number that ALREADY went green, list those in green_specs, and use notes to say exactly where to resume: the branch, the run set, and what remains. A resumable gate is worth far more to the lead than a blank one, and it is the difference between re-running one run and re-running all ${GATE_N}. ` +
