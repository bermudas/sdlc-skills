// Campaign conductor for the test-automation batch pipeline (Claude Code).
// Runs a multi-wave campaign per references/campaign-planning.md by invoking
// the shipped build workflow as a CHILD per wave (workflow() nesting) — that
// child integrates and gates internally and returns ONE report per wave.
//
// The orchestrator's context stays LEAN by design: the lead never reads case
// bodies (a dispatched PLANNER reads the intake snapshots and proposes the
// plan), never sees analysis payloads or diffs (children summarize), and
// receives only compact returns at three checkpoints:
//   1. Plan proposal   — early return; lead reviews the PLAN, not the cases.
//   2. Foundation      — conductor builds, reviews, AND mini-gates it
//                        (smoke × N green); early return for the lead to
//                        merge foundation to base and re-invoke.
//   3. Rolling waves   — each wave is ONE build child, which integrates and
//                        gates internally and returns ONE report. The conductor
//                        collects those reports and rolls on; it never gates,
//                        never merges PRs, never mirrors.
// A failed wave (child throws) is recorded whole and the campaign continues.
//
// No board: a wave's report IS its state (batch-build § WHY NO BOARD). Waves
// share one case-snapshot directory (.agents/automation/<batch>/cases/) and one
// campaign card; each wave integrates onto its own branch (tests/batch-<slug>).
//
// Invocations (lead):
//   propose:  { propose: { campaign, batch, base, cases: [{id,title?},…], casePaths?, waveSize?, policy? } }
//   run:      { plan, foundationMerged? }   // plan from the approved proposal
