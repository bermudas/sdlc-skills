// Batch-stabilize workflow — fix a RED hardening gate, at the batch level.
// Claude Code only — invoked by the lead AFTER classifying the red:
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: '<installed skill>/scripts/workflows/batch-stabilize.workflow.mjs',
//              args: { slug, base, branch, failures: [{spec, signature, case_ids?}], … } })
//
// WHEN TO USE IT. Only after the lead has classified a red as a TEST-CODE bug
// or a flake. Two moments produce one: a batch trunk that failed its hardening
// gate (nothing landed yet — fixing it unblocks the batch), or the campaign-end
// delivered-suite check going red after every wave has already landed. The
// second is fix-forward on a branch cut from base; the workflow does not care
// which, it fixes whatever `branch` carries the red. A product defect goes to the tracker and the test
// stays red (a red test exposing a real bug is correct). An architectural gap
// goes to § Framework architecture. This workflow assumes the classification is
// already made — it does not re-litigate it.
//
// WHY THE BATCH IS THE UNIT. The hardening gate runs the batch's specs TOGETHER
// precisely because that surfaces failures a per-case run never sees, so the
// failures it uniquely finds are batch-level BY CONSTRUCTION — shared fixture
// state, ordering, parallel interference. Fixing them one case at a time hands
// each fixer a single symptom of a cause that spans several. Measured, from one
// campaign's red cases:
//   * an unscoped global `console_errors` list leaked a step-1 404 into later,
//     unrelated assertions — nondeterministically;
//   * a fixture 500 that fired before the test body ran at all;
//   * a test-data cleanup race ("no such conversation", different id each run).
// Not one of those is a bug in "its" case. Three separate fix dispatches would
// have seen three symptoms and never assembled the picture.
//
// SHAPE. Diagnose across ALL failures first (one agent, whole picture), then fix
// by CAUSE (sequential — they write code in the one working tree), then re-gate.
// Bounded: ≤2 rounds, then stop and report. It never merges and never decides
// that a remaining red is acceptable.
//
// This is also the first `kind: fix` instance of the pipeline's shape: the
// investigation step is reproducing-issues discipline (reproduce and isolate a
// failure) rather than the build's discretionary live probing; build / review /
// gate are the same skeleton.
