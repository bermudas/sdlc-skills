// other agents, failure signatures from a test runner, tickets from an
// implementer. None of it is authored by these scripts, and all of it arrives
// inside something that IS instructions.

// Workflow scripts run in a sandbox with no module access, so the three copies
// are duplicated on purpose. These tests EXECUTE the real source rather than
// grepping for it: a guard nothing runs is a guard nobody can trust, and text
// assertions would pass on a copy that had been quietly broken.
