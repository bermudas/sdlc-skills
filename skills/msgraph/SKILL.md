# Microsoft Graph Skill

Provides Microsoft 365 data access via the Microsoft Graph API. Two operating modes:

## Mode 1 — LLM-less Scan Scripts (Scheduled)

Four scripts run autonomously on a schedule without involving an LLM:

| Script | What it scans |
|---|---|
| `scripts/scan-email.py` | Inbox messages newer than `--since` |
| `scripts/scan-teams.py` | Teams channel messages newer than `--since` |
| `scripts/scan-calendar.py` | Calendar events starting within `--since` window |
| `scripts/scan-sharepoint.py` | SharePoint/OneDrive files modified within `--since` |

### Common CLI arguments

```
--since     Lookback window, e.g. 1h, 4h, 24h, 7d  (default: 1h)
--output    Path for JSON output                     (default: .octobots/m365-inbox.json)
--relay     Path to a relay/taskbox script to call when items are found
--role      Role name passed to the relay for routing
```

### Per-script additional arguments

| Script | Extra flag | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `scan-email.py` | `--sender boss@company.com` | Filter to a specific sender |
| `scan-teams.py` | `--team-id TEAM_ID` | Limit to a single team |
| `scan-calendar.py` | `--hours-ahead 24` | Look forward N hours instead of backward |
| `scan-sharepoint.py` | `--site-id SITE_ID` | Scan a SharePoint site instead of personal OneDrive |

### How results are delivered

1. If no items are found the script exits silently (exit code 0).
2. If items are found they are **appended** (not overwritten) to `--output` as a JSON array.
3. If `--relay` is provided the script calls:
   ```
   python3 <relay> --role <role> --data <output_path>
   ```
   The relay is responsible for pushing a taskbox notification to the named role.

### Output record shape

Every item in the output JSON array has the following fields:

```json
{
  "source":  "email | teams | calendar | sharepoint",
  "ts":      "2026-04-04T11:00:00+00:00",
  "summary": "one-line description",
  "detail":  { /* raw API fields */ },
  "urgent":  false
}
```

### Example cron entry

```
0 * * * *  cd /path/to/project && python3 scripts/scan-email.py --since 1h --relay .octobots/relay.py --role triage
```

## Mode 2 — Interactive Query via Claude (Bash Tool)

`scripts/query.py` is called by Claude during a session when the user asks about their Microsoft 365 data.

**Typed subcommands (recommended):**
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py email --filter "isRead eq false" --select "subject,from" --top 20
python3 scripts/query.py teams channels --team-id TEAM_ID
python3 scripts/query.py teams messages --team-id TEAM_ID --channel-id CHANNEL_ID --top 20
python3 scripts/query.py calendar --start 2026-04-04 --end 2026-04-11
python3 scripts/query.py sharepoint files --drive-id DRIVE_ID --path /Documents
```

**Sample file mode:**
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --sample samples/email/unread-today.yaml
```

**Raw endpoint mode:**
```bash
python3 scripts/query.py --endpoint "/me/messages" --filter "isRead eq false" --select "subject,from" --top 20
python3 scripts/query.py --endpoint "/me/calendarView" --params "startDateTime=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&endDateTime=2024-01-07T23:59:59Z"
```

Results are printed as pretty-printed JSON to stdout. Claude reads and summarises them for the user.
All pages are fetched automatically via `@odata.nextLink` pagination.

Sample YAML files in `samples/` describe pre-built queries that Claude can run by name.

## Authentication

Scripts auto-install Python dependencies into `~/.msgraph-skill/.venv/` on first
run — no manual `pip install` or venv creation needed. A built-in Azure AD app ID
is used by default, so no environment variables or Azure portal setup is required
for most users.

Token cache is stored at `~/.msgraph-skill/token_cache.json` (shared across all
projects — authenticate once, use everywhere).

### Login flow (important for Claude)

When the user is not authenticated, **run `auth.py login` via Bash tool**. The
output will contain `LOGIN_URL=...` and `LOGIN_CODE=...` lines. **You must relay
both values to the user in your response** — they need to open the URL in their
browser and enter the code to complete sign-in. The script blocks until they do.

```
python3 scripts/auth.py login    # Device-code flow — relay URL and code to user
python3 scripts/auth.py status   # Check token validity
python3 scripts/auth.py logout   # Clear cached credentials
```

### Environment variables (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SDLC_SKILLS_CACHE_DIR` | `~/.msgraph-skill` | Shared cache root for all sdlc-skills (token cache, venv). When set, msgraph stores its data under `$SDLC_SKILLS_CACHE_DIR/msgraph/`. |
| `MSGRAPH_CLIENT_ID` | `084a3e9f-a9f4-43f7-89f9-d229cf97853e` | Override with your own Azure AD app |
| `MSGRAPH_TENANT_ID` | `common` | Restrict to a specific tenant |

Variables can be set via environment or in a `.env` file at the skill root or cwd.
Most users do not need to set these.

### Custom Azure AD app (advanced)

If your organisation blocks third-party app IDs or you need additional permissions,
register your own Azure AD app:

1. [Azure portal → App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps) → New registration.
2. Add delegated permissions: `Mail.Read`, `Calendars.Read`, `Team.ReadBasic.All`,
   `Channel.ReadBasic.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `Files.Read.All`.
3. Under Authentication → Add platform → Mobile and desktop, enable the
   `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient` redirect URI.
4. Set `MSGRAPH_CLIENT_ID=<your-app-id>` in your `.env` and re-run login.

## Installation

### Claude Code plugin marketplace

```
/plugin install sdlc-skills@msgraph
```

### Direct install via npx

```bash
npx github:arozumenko/sdlc-skills init --skills msgraph --target claude
```

Python dependencies are installed automatically into `~/.msgraph-skill/.venv/`
on first script run — no manual setup needed.

### First-time authentication

```bash
python3 scripts/auth.py login
```
