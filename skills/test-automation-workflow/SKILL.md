## Test Automation Workflow: Explore → Specify → Implement → Review

**Core philosophy:** do not automate what you have not executed. Every case is
run manually first — pick whichever browser tool is wired and fits the
challenge (`playwright-testing` over MCP, `playwright-cli` from the shell,
`browser-verify` over CDP; full triage in
[`references/browser-tools.md`](references/browser-tools.md)) — so defects,
missing data, and environmental gaps are surfaced *before* a line of
automation code is written. Then a separate engineer implements the
automation inside the project's existing framework. Then a reviewer
re-runs it.

**Why split the work into two agents:** context. The analysis pass
carries exploration state (DOM snapshots, test data, console noise)
through the `test-case-analysis` skill — Sage (qa-engineer) owns that.
The automation engineer carries framework state (page objects,
fixtures, CI config) — Axel owns that. Review is a natural third step
but re-uses Sage once the test is written. Cramming all of that into
one context breaks the bot; the skill split keeps each workspace lean
even though only two personas touch it.

**Composed capabilities (not reinvented here):** browser-driving for
analyst execution, bug filing for defects discovered along the way,
code review for the PR step, test-completion / TMS back-write for
handoff, project context from scout. Which specific skills provide
those capabilities is the calling agents' concern — this workflow
describes the *flow*, not the toolchain. When the calling agent has
multiple browser-driving capabilities available, the triage in
[`references/browser-tools.md`](references/browser-tools.md) covers
how to pick between MCP / CLI / CDP shapes.

## Routing — how PM resolves slots to agents

This section is PM's **source of truth** for the flow. PM's own
AGENT.md keeps only the triage-row entry and a pointer back here —
the details below are what PM loads when the first TMS-case request
lands.

The pipeline has three **slots** — each a separate session, gated on
intermediate status:

- **Analyst slot** — execute the case, emit an AFS
- **Implementer slot** — AFS → green test → PR
- **Reviewer slot** — approve the PR

```
User drops TMS case / batch
   ↓
PM (Max)    — routes intake, owns merge gate
   ↓
Analyst slot → AFS file on disk + status
   ↓ (PM gates on status before forwarding)
Implementer slot → green test + PR
   ↓ (PM routes for review)
Reviewer slot (+ code-review skill) → approval
   ↓
PM          — merges, closes the issue, confirms TMS back-write
```

### Slot defaults

When all dedicated agents are installed:

| Slot | Agent | Skill loaded |
|---|---|---|
| Analyst | `qa-engineer` (Sage) | `test-case-analysis` |
| Implementer | `test-automation-engineer` (Axel) | `test-automation-workflow` |
| Reviewer | `qa-engineer` (fresh session) | `code-review` |

**If `.agents/role-overrides.md` is present** (scout's Step 6.9
output, auto-imported at the top of PM's AGENT.md via
`@.agents/role-overrides.md`), use its mappings instead — some slots
will be filled by substitute agents (typically a language-matched
dev when Axel isn't installed). The file is authoritative for the
project; the defaults above are the sdlc-skills baseline. See
`project-seeder` § Step 6.9 for how scout writes the overrides.

### The three-step flow

1. **Analyst slot.** Executes the case end-to-end against the live
   app, captures stable selectors, files defects (via the analyst
   agent's bug-filing capability — see profile.md § Bug filing) if
   any, and emits an AFS at
   `test-specs/<feature>/l<pri>_<slug>_<tms-id>.md`. Returns AFS path
   plus a status:
   `ready-for-automation` / `blocked` / `defect-found` / `un-automatable`.

2. **PM gates on the status before forwarding.** Only
   `ready-for-automation` advances. For the others:
   - `blocked` → unblock (access, data, env) or escalate
   - `defect-found` → route the filed bug through the normal bug
     pipeline; parked automation resumes after the fix
   - `un-automatable` → close the request with a note; do not route

3. **Implementer slot.** Reads AFS, writes the test in the project's
   existing framework (per `.agents/testing.md`), runs it locally and
   in CI, opens a PR, back-writes the TMS execution.

4. **Reviewer slot.** Runs the `code-review` skill for code quality +
   test-correctness checks.

PM merges once both gates pass (see `project-manager` § Merging
approved PRs for the merge protocol — that lives with PM because the
merge gate is PM's responsibility regardless of work type).

### Handoff prompts name the slot

Always name the slot in the handoff so the agent is clear about its
role in the pipeline. Under substitution, this framing lets any
installed agent pick up the slot without confusion:

> You are the **implementer** for SCRUM-T101 (AFS at
> `test-specs/checkout/l2_apply-promo_SCRUM-T101.md`). Follow
> `test-automation-workflow` Step 5–6.

### Why three separate sessions (even when one persona fills two slots)

Each *session* carries different context — analysis holds DOM
snapshots and test data, implementation holds framework state and
page-object code, review holds test-honesty suspicion. Cramming all
of that into one session fragments context and breaks the bot, even
when the persona is the same.

**Freshness is the default, not a host-specific mechanism.** On
every host relevant to this workflow — Claude Code, Copilot CLI,
Cursor, Windsurf, Octobots — invoking a subagent spawns an
**isolated context**: `messages=[]`, only the task prompt flows
in, only the final message comes back. Nothing from the analysis
session leaks into review. PM just calls the reviewer subagent
normally.

**What PM does have to get right is the prompt.** The reviewer
subagent starts with no memory of who wrote the code, so PM must
frame the task explicitly:

> You are the **reviewer** for SCRUM-T101. You did NOT write this
> code — another session of qa-engineer wrote the AFS and
> test-automation-engineer implemented the PR. Load the
> `code-review` skill, read AFS at `test-specs/checkout/l2_…md`
> and PR `<url>`, and report findings with file:line references.
> Be honest about assertions, selector stability, and defect
> masking.

Without that framing, the subagent might assume it wrote the
code and rubber-stamp. See `code-review` skill § review prompt
for the full template.

### When to involve tech-lead (Rio) instead

The routine flow is self-contained: analyst → implementer → reviewer.
Tech-lead is **not** in the hot path for routine TMS cases — pulling
tech-lead into every review defeats the pipeline's throughput. PM
routes through tech-lead for three situations:

1. **Greenfield framework bootstrap.** No existing test framework in
   the repo. Tech-lead picks the scaffold per language (see
   [references/framework-scaffold.md](references/framework-scaffold.md)),
   defines the page-object and fixture conventions, and writes /
   approves the initial `.agents/testing.md`. The implementer (Axel
   or substitute) then executes that plan for the first case.
2. **Framework-scale work.** New fixture infrastructure, new
   page-object base class, CI pipeline changes, framework version
   upgrades, new TMS adapter beyond the supported set — tech-lead
   owns the decision. Route: PM → tech-lead (plan) → implementer
   (execution) → reviewer slot + tech-lead (PR review, paired).
3. **Mid-flow architectural escalation.** When analyst or implementer
   explicitly returns `needs-tech-lead` — a gap surfaced that the
   existing conventions don't cover (shared auth-state problem,
   missing fixture primitive, cross-cutting page-object refactor).
   PM pauses the case, pairs tech-lead with the escalator to resolve,
   then resumes the flow from where it paused.

If unsure whether a request is routine or framework-scale: check
`.agents/testing.md`. If the framework is named and the AFS fits the
existing page-object / fixture model, it's routine. If the AFS needs
something `.agents/testing.md` doesn't describe, it's an escalation.

**If `tech-lead` isn't installed**, PM uses the substitute named in
`.agents/role-overrides.md` (scout's Step 6.9 output) — typically
the language-matched dev (`python-dev` for a Python project,
`js-dev` for TS/JS, etc., per the fallback table in
`project-seeder` `references/role-overrides.md`). Axel's
"return `needs-tech-lead` to PM" protocol still works: the return
lands at PM, PM reads `role-overrides.md`, PM routes to the
substitute. Axel doesn't need to know who the substitute is.

### Status gating, restated

PM must not forward a `blocked` / `defect-found` / `un-automatable`
AFS downstream. The implementer will refuse and it's a wasted
round-trip. Resolve or close upstream first.

## The eight steps

```
1. Discover framework          (read what scout produced)
2. Ingest case from TMS         (pluggable adapter)
3. Execute manually             (analyst slot via `test-case-analysis`)
4. Produce automation-ready spec (analyst emits AFS markdown)
5. Implement automation         (implementer slot — project framework)
6. Run & stabilize              (implementer — green or real defect)
7. Review                       (reviewer slot + code-review skill)
8. Deliver & sync TMS           (task-completion + TMS adapter back-write)
```

Steps 1–4 belong to the analyst slot. Steps 5–6 belong to the
implementer slot. Step 7 is the reviewer slot. Step 8 is the
handoff. PM resolves each slot to a concrete agent at routing time.

### 1. Discover framework

Before anything, read what the scout / project-seeder already produced:

- `AGENTS.md` — tech stack, test commands
- `.agents/testing.md` — test framework, commands, fixtures, CI
- `.agents/architecture.md` — system map (for data flow awareness)
- `.agents/profile.md` — languages, default branch
- `.agents/test-automation.yaml` — TMS config + framework hints (if present)

**If none of these exist**, run [`project-seeder`](../project-seeder/) first.
Do not try to automate into a codebase you have not mapped.

Detect the framework yourself if `testing.md` doesn't name it:

```bash
# Playwright
test -f playwright.config.ts -o -f playwright.config.js && echo "playwright"
# Cypress
test -f cypress.config.ts -o -f cypress.config.js && echo "cypress"
# Selenium / Java
find . -name "pom.xml" -maxdepth 3 -exec grep -l "selenium\|playwright" {} \;
# Pytest + Playwright-python
grep -r "pytest-playwright\|playwright.sync_api" --include="*.txt" --include="*.toml" . 2>/dev/null | head
# WebdriverIO
test -f wdio.conf.ts -o -f wdio.conf.js && echo "wdio"
```

**No framework yet?** Scaffold a minimal one aligned with the project's
language (see [references/framework-scaffold.md](references/framework-scaffold.md)).
Never import a foreign stack — if the project is Python, don't ship a
Node-based framework.

### 2. Ingest case from TMS

TMS is pluggable along two axes — **adapter** (which TMS) and
**transport** (HTTP or MCP). The active combination is declared in
`.agents/test-automation.yaml` (see [references/tms-adapters.md](references/tms-adapters.md)).

Supported adapters out of the box: `zephyr-scale`, `testrail`, `xray`,
`azure-test-plans`, `markdown` (plain files). Each adapter exposes the
same verbs regardless of transport:

```
fetch_case(id)       → returns { id, name, preconditions, steps, expected, cleanup, links }
update_execution(id, status, evidence) → back-writes result
```

**Transport choice:**

- `transport: mcp` — preferred when the host already has a TMS MCP
  server configured (Elitea, Atlassian Remote MCP, a vendor TestRail /
  Xray MCP). The adapter calls `mcp__<server>__<tool>` instead of
  issuing HTTP. Secrets live in the host's MCP config, never in the
  project repo.
- `transport: http` — the TMS's public API with credentials from env
  vars. Works everywhere without host integration.

If no adapter is configured, default to `markdown`: cases live in
`test-specs/{feature}/l{priority}_{name}.md`.

**Never hardcode a TMS.** All TMS logic flows through the adapter.

### 3. Execute manually (Sage via `test-case-analysis`)

The [`qa-engineer`](../../agents/qa-engineer/) agent — persona **Sage** —
runs the case step-by-step with the real application, using the
[`test-case-analysis`](../test-case-analysis/) skill:

- UI cases → [`playwright-testing`](../playwright-testing/) MCP tools,
  preferring `browser_snapshot` for accessible-name discovery.
- Fallback / deep inspection → [`browser-verify`](../browser-verify/)
  (CDP — real input events, computed styles, storage).
- API cases → `curl` / project's HTTP client.

For every step: screenshot, console, network. For every assertion: proof.

**Output of this phase is truth, not code.** What actually happened, not
what the case says should happen.

### 4. Produce automation-ready spec (AFS)

Sage (running `test-case-analysis`) writes an **Automation-Friendly Spec** (AFS) — a markdown file
in `test-specs/{feature}/l{priority}_{slug}_{tms-id}.md`. Format and
required sections live in [../test-case-analysis/references/spec-format.md](../test-case-analysis/references/spec-format.md).
Key additions beyond a plain test case:

- **Stable selectors** discovered during exploration (`data-testid` >
  ARIA role > label > text > CSS — last resort)
- **Test data inventory** — what already exists, what must be generated,
  what must be cleaned up
- **Defects found during exploration** — filed via the analyst
  agent's bug-filing capability; the AFS lists them as known-failing
  expectations
- **Blocked steps** — steps Sage could not execute (access, environment,
  missing data) — Axel must resolve or escalate

If the case cannot be automated at all (e.g. physical card reader),
Sage says so explicitly and stops. Don't write automation for
un-automatable cases.

### 5. Implement automation (automation engineer)

The [`test-automation-engineer`](../../agents/test-automation-engineer/)
agent — persona **Axel** — reads the AFS and works through three
**recommended** sub-phases (5a → 5b → 5c) before writing test code, then
implements (5d).

Sub-phases 5a–5c are **soft guidelines**, not PR gates: PM doesn't
reject a PR for missing them. They're how Axel avoids the most common
quality failures (foreign conventions, duplicated helpers, broken
shared infra, missed serial-mode dependencies). On simple, isolated
cases Axel can fold them into a few quick checks; on cases touching
shared infra, they should produce an explicit short design note that
becomes part of the PR body.

#### 5a. Conventions sweep (recommended)

Before writing, sweep the existing tests for the surface this AFS
touches:

- Read `.agents/testing.md` end to end. Note the run command, locator
  ladder, serial policy, helpers organisation, steps-extraction style,
  and test-data layout this project actually uses.
- `ls` the test directory tree; confirm folder roles match `testing.md`.
- Open **three neighbouring tests** in the same feature area or
  touching the same page object. The conventions are in the muscle
  memory of those files, not just the README.
- `grep` for the helpers / fixtures / page objects the AFS will
  exercise — re-use before create.
- `grep` for repeated literals (URLs, selectors, strings) in the
  surface you'll extend; a third repetition signals a helper.

Output (informally — a few bullets in the PR body, or a longer note for
shared-infra cases): the file you'll add to, the helpers/fixtures/POs
you'll reuse, what's NEW, the exact run command, serial vs parallel
mode.

#### 5b. Test data strategy (recommended)

For every datum the AFS lists in its test-data inventory, decide:

| Class | When to use | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|
| `reuse-existing` | A static fixture already exists and the test doesn't mutate it | None |
| `generate-per-test` | The test needs a fresh unique record (preferred for write-heavy paths) | `afterEach` |
| `generate-shared-with-cleanup` | Multiple tests share an expensive setup | `afterAll`, owned by the describe |

**Scan the test-data directory first** (path lives in `.agents/testing.md`).
Reuse before creating. If creating, match the existing factory /
fixture pattern — don't introduce a new mechanism.

When the AFS data inventory declares **shared state** across steps or
tests in the file, set serial mode (`test.describe.configure({ mode:
'serial' })` or the framework equivalent). Parallel execution on
shared state is a flake source, not a feature.

#### 5c. Impacted-surface check (recommended)

If your design from 5a touches a shared helper, page object, fixture,
or environment file:

- `grep` (by symbol or path) for everything that depends on it
- List the dependents in the design note
- Plan to rerun the dependent slice as part of Phase 6 — scope by
  symbol/file, not full-suite

If you're only adding to an isolated test file with no shared edits,
mark "no shared edits — isolated test" and skip the rerun.

If your design **needs** something the project doesn't have yet (a new
page-object base, a new fixture primitive, a CI-config change, a TMS
adapter beyond the supported set), return `needs-tech-lead` to PM.
Don't invent shared infra mid-PR.

#### 5d. Implementation

Now write the test:

1. Match the framework conventions 1:1. Page Object Model only on the
   upgraded scaffold path (see `references/framework-scaffold.md`) or
   when the existing project already uses it. On flat / primitive-heavy
   projects, use the framework's own primitives directly.
2. Extend existing page objects / helpers / fixtures; don't duplicate.
3. Use the locator ladder (see `references/framework-scaffold.md` —
   `getByRole` first, then testid, then label/text, CSS last). Stop+flag
   if the app has no test IDs and roles/labels aren't sufficient.
4. Use environment variables from the project's existing loader — never
   hardcode URLs, creds, test data. Before adding a new env key,
   `grep` the existing `.env*` files; reuse over duplicate.
5. Apply a TDD mindset: run-fail-fix-run until green, never demote
   assertions.

**Helpers are trusted.** When the test fails and the helper has worked
elsewhere, suspect the test first. Don't mutate shared code to fix an
isolated symptom — that's how the regression-impact problem starts.

**No Defect Masking Rule:**

| Failure type | Permitted action |
|---|---|
| Infrastructure (bad selector, timing, env) | Fix selector/wait/env. Re-run. |
| Product defect, isolated step | `expect.soft()` (or framework equivalent) with `// Known defect: <id>` comment. Rest of test runs. |
| Product defect, blocks execution | Let it fail naturally. Open a ticket via your agent's bug-filing capability (per profile.md § Bug filing). Do NOT run a dev-side fix lifecycle from inside the test run. Do NOT `test.fail()`. |

Forbidden — regardless of any scope argument:

- Removing an assertion to turn green
- Demoting `expect()` to `console.warn`
- Swapping the failing assertion for a weaker one
- Using `page.evaluate()` to bypass a CSS/DOM check the AC requires
- Using `test.fail()` / `xit()` / `@Ignore` to hide a real product bug

### 6. Run & stabilize

The test runs reliably (pass or fails for a *real* product reason). Run
it locally with the exact command from `.agents/testing.md` § Run
commands (single test), then the CI variant. Local-green and CI-green
can differ (headless vs headed, viewport, retry); reconcile both
before declaring done.

Flaky tests are not done — identify the source (network, timing,
data) and fix it. Mark `@flaky` only if the project already has that
tagging convention.

#### 6a. Soft retry budget (recommended)

If you're re-running the same test more than ~3 times against the same
root cause, **stop and escalate** to PM rather than keep adjusting.
"Retry until green" is fishing, not debugging.

Capture in the PR body:

- How many reruns it took to get a stable signal
- The root cause of any flakes you fixed along the way
- Total run duration of the final green run (becomes a baseline for
  future regressions — if a future rerun exceeds ~2× this, it's a
  smell worth investigating)

This is not a hard gate; it's a paper trail. PM uses the rerun count
and root-cause notes as a signal when reviewing.

#### 6b. Regression rerun (when 5c flagged dependents)

If Phase 5c listed dependent tests (because you edited a shared helper,
page object, fixture, or env file), rerun that scoped slice as part of
Phase 6. Use grep on the symbol or path to find them; don't run the
full suite unless the dependents really are the full suite. Block the
PR if any dependent test fails — fix the dependency, not the test
you just wrote.

### 7. Review

Two reviewers in parallel:

- **[`qa-engineer`](../../agents/qa-engineer/)** (Sage) — does the test
  actually prove the AC? Is the assertion strong enough? Would a
  refactor survive? Is the sad path covered?
- **[`code-review`](../code-review/)** skill — code quality, fixture
  discipline, selector stability, naming, dead code.
NOTE: Reviewer must be explicitely informed that it reviews someone else's work, not its own. Otherwise it will be biased and less effective. See `code-review` skill for review prompt details.
Reviewer comments feed back to Axel. Re-run after changes.

### 8. Deliver & sync TMS

Follow [`task-completion`](../task-completion/) — commit on a feature
branch, push, `gh pr create`, comment on the originating issue. Then use
the TMS adapter to back-write the execution result (`update_execution`)
so the TMS dashboard reflects reality.

## Batching multiple cases

When the user drops a bag of cases ("automate all of SPRINT-42's regression
suite"):

- **Analysis phase** parallelizes well. Spawn one Sage sub-agent per
  case (each runs the `test-case-analysis` skill in its own session)
  — each gets its own browser context and its own AFS output file.
  Collect results, verify files on disk, recreate any that didn't persist.
- **Automation phase** can also parallelize, *but* guard the page-object
  layer — two agents racing to edit `login.page.ts` will collide. Serialize
  any case that touches the same page object.
- **Review phase** — batch is fine; one reviewer pass per PR, not per case.

See [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) for concrete
`runSubagent` / `Agent` / `Task` recipes by host.

## Anti-patterns

- **Automating an unexecuted case.** You don't know what the app does
  until you've driven it. Don't skip step 3.
- **Copying framework conventions from a different project.** Read
  `.agents/testing.md` and the existing `tests/` directory. Match
  what's there.
- **Hardcoding the TMS.** Everything goes through the adapter. If the
  project migrates from Zephyr to TestRail, you swap one config line,
  not the workflow.
- **Masking a product defect with `test.fail()`, `xit`, or `@Ignore`.**
  A red test is the correct signal. File the bug, don't hide it.
- **One-shot mega-agent.** Context fragmentation is a feature, not a
  bug. Respect the three-role split.
- **"I wrote the code and it compiles."** Not done. Not until the test
  ran green (or red for a real product reason), evidence captured, PR
  open, TMS updated.
